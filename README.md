A full-stack restaurant management system with a customer-facing website and admin panel.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main components:

- **Frontend (dinrestaurang/)**: Customer-facing website consists of meals.
- **Admin Panel (adminpanel/)**: Restaurant management interface
- **Backend (server/)**: RESTful API server

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
